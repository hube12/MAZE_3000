Welcome to Maze 3000 !

In this challenge the goal is to get back the key that solve the maze, there is 
two ways to explore the maze, first one is using the executable and just running it 
in a console (use at least 45lines*100columns one). The other is by providing a
number to the executable and it will trace the maze and told you if it is the correct
key.

Currently due to linux terminal, we enabled raw mode, that might throw you off as your 
terminal might appear unresponsive, be sure to use a compliant one, you can hit ESC at
any time to exit the program, else just fail/win at it and it will exit.

Once you reversed the key, please use the unhasher executable that unhash the hash 
(available in the hash executable) and use this command to grep the correct flag. (might take real 0m26.811s)

./unhasher <key> | grep "^Fg{.*}$" | head -n 1

The format of the flag is Fg{XXX...XXXX}, the first one outputted by the unhasher executable
is the right one (there is many collisions ;)

Don't get fooled, this might look easy !
